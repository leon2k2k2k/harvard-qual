7/27:

keep writing out the general theory of curvature in DG. Just take the time to do that today, its okay if you don't get to any exercises. Just write them well, you will have two more days to do those problem. Go through the problem to check that 


7/28: Keep going with DG, let's finish this before the month end!!!!!

7/29: I think I figured out the orthonormal approach to covariant derivative, now let's try to solve those damn problems.



7/30: with whatever time you have left, Look at the Sylow theorem, groups of order p, p^2, pq, p^3, and potentially do specific character table for A_n, S_n, D_n for n \leq 4. 



The qual guide and there is a real analysis cheat sheet by dexter. 

8/3: A lot of real analysis stuff to learn/review. Including Banach spaces, the Baire theorem, 



8/5: finished Fourier series stuff and then tryyy to do problems til 8/5.
