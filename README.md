# harvard-qual
My notes in preparation for the Fall 21 Harvard Math Qualification exam. Note that the materials covered here is a reflection of what I am familiar and unfamiliar with.

The 6 subjects are Algebra (A), Algebraic Geometry (AG), Algebraic Topology (AT), Differential Geometry (DG), Real Analysis (RA), and Complex Analysis (CA). Currently the DG, A, and RA are written out. The RA one is in much more detail as I had to learn most of them as I am prepping for the quals.
