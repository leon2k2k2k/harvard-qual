# harvard-qual
My notes in preparation for the Fall 21 Harvard Math Qualification exam. Note that the materials covered here is a reflection of what I am familiar and unfamiliar with.

The 6 subjects are Algebra (A), Algebraic Geometry (AG), Algebraic Topology (AT), Differential Geometry (DG), Real Analysis (RA), and Complex Analysis (CA). Currently the DG, A, and RA and CA are written out. 

For RA and CA I have followed textbooks and written out summaries of them.

# status of preparation for each subjects:

A. Pretty comfortable, feel like only need practice with finding polynomials whose splitting field has certain Galois group.

AG. Pretty good. I would like to go through Harris's "lecture notes" for some of the projective geometry part, like quadratic hypersurfaces etc.

AT. The most comfortable with. If I have time I would like to take a morning to do some reviewing.

DG. Okay, mostly need calculation practices with Guassian curvature and stuff.

RA. Need help. Not really comfortable with all of the questions. Need knowledge on the esoteric topology of things, namely the Baire category theory and its applications.

CA. Currently working on it. Doing a lot better than RA. Hopefully after this week I will be pretty good with it.

After reviewing through CA, let's go back and take a look at all the questions from 2010-2016 for all subjects and write down what I am not comfortable with.
