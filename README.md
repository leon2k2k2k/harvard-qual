My notes in preparation for the Fall 21 Harvard Math Qualification exam. Note that the materials covered here is a reflection of what I am familiar and unfamiliar with.

The 6 subjects are Algebra (A), Algebraic Geometry (AG), Algebraic Topology (AT), Differential Geometry (DG), Real Analysis (RA), and Complex Analysis (CA). Currently the DG and A section are written out.
