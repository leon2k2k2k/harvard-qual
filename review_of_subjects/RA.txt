8/19 Real Analysis review:

Initial thoughts:
Need to learn the "dark magic" Baire category theorem, and its consequences Open Mapping Theorem, closed graph theorem and uniform boundedness principle. Use it to prove that any self-adjoint operator on a hilbert space is bounded.
After that I can review the different parts of real analysis.
Make sure you understand all the inequalities!!!!!
Write down all the inequality. They are all in the real analysis notes.


Overview:
I feel pretty good about this. First let's review Baire category theory, and commuting derivatives under integral. I would also like to just review commuting limits more.


After that, try to remember the important formulas, then 
just goes through the questions again and make sure you understand how it works.
Should take 1.5 - 2 days.

specific things:
define L^p spaces as lebesgue measureable functions whose L^p norm is finite, why is this complete? Aka why does Cauchy sequence converge.
Make sure to understand the condition for derivative and integral to commute (via dominated convergence theorem) and know how the argument goes.

--------------
Fourier series and Fourier transform:
decay of coefficients and smoothness: F10D2, F11D1, F15D3 (got the Sobolev embedding theorem vibe). S15D2 (actual Fourier series calculation), F16D2 (interesting), F17D3, 


--------
Banach spaces:
Show boundedness and (non)-compactness of specific operators: F10D3, F11D2, S16D2, 
Topology of Hilbert and Banach spaces:
    Weak topology, compactness: S10D2, 
    Baire category theorem:
    Separablility: F11D3. 
    Contraction theorem: S16D1, 
-------
Hilbert space:
show the parallelogram rule, F16D3, 



----
heat equation: review different boundary conditions. F12D2, F14D1

---
Measure theory: Remembers all the inequality.
general: S10D3, S13D2 (Jensen's inequality)

Convergence: F12D1 (dominated convergence), S12D1 (convergence in measure vs a.e. convergence)

Probability:the Chebyshev inequality and other??? F12D3, F14D3, 


---
Miscallenous: S14. do S16D3, F17D3 (green function for the Laplacian in 3 dimension).
F15D2 is kinda fun.
