8/19 DG review:

initial thoughts:
There are three parts to me: 1. Riemannian geometry and curvature calculations, a lot of Guassian curvature calculations. I think I just need to do more practice with these calculations, using both the Riemann curvature tensor method (R^1 _{212}) and orthonormal frame, as well as using first and second fundamental forms. 2. Differential topology stuff. 3. ODE calculations, either geodesic or integral curves and parallel transport. I struggles with actually solving the ODE.

BASICALLY DO MORE CALCULATIONS.

Must remember: Lagrangian for the geodesic equation and the Euler Lagrange equation.
Sard's theorem, how lie derivative and d work (Cartan's magic formula).

Overview: CALCULATIONS. More specifically ODE calculations and surface curvature calculations!
