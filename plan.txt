8/22 plan:

Things I need to work on:
1. CA and RA. For CA I need to learn about entire functions and convergence, go through the CA.txt file and look through all the previous questions.
For RA I need Baire category theory and limit stuff like criterion for derivative and integral to commute etc. Let's try to finish learning all the new materials and go back into practice questions/calculation mode, esp. for DG.
2. I need to really review the newer tests. If I have time I would also like to review some older ones but who knows.
3. I think the last exam let's take the full three hours and really sit down and simulate the testing environment. The last two exams I need to fully write out the answers to questions.


8/22 comfortability for each subjects:
A. pretty comfortable, just need a quick review and ready to get it behind me.
AG. Quite comfortable, ready Harris's lecture notes and going through the problem again really helps.
AT. Again quite quite comfortable, feel like I can do most problems just from looking at it.
DG. Really need practice with solving ODE and stuff!!!!! Also need calculation practices.
RA. Not comfortable with it, there are quite things I need to learn and also need to be better with just basic real analysis stuff. Go through the questions.
CA. Same here, learn and go through.

I think the plan is let's do CA next, learn entire function then go through all the questions we have had so far and do them. Then do RA.
