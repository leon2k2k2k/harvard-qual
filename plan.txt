A. Pretty comfortable, feel like only need practice with finding polynomials whose splitting field has certain Galois group.

AG. Pretty good. I would like to go through Harris's "lecture notes" for some of the projective geometry part, like quadratic hypersurfaces etc.

AT. The most comfortable with. If I have time I would like to take a morning to do some reviewing.

DG. Okay, mostly need calculation practices with Guassian curvature and stuff.

RA. Need help. Not really comfortable with all of the questions. Need knowledge on the esoteric topology of things, namely the Baire category theory and its applications.

CA. Currently working on it. Doing a lot better than RA. Hopefully after this week I will be pretty good with it.

plan:

By Fri. 13th, finished CA problem review.

Weekend:
After reviewing through CA, let's go back and take a look at all the questions from 2010-2016 for all subjects and write down topics/things I am not that comfortable with. If have time, also go through 2005-2009 (skim through). 

Then come back with a plan to review through those topics.
Ideally, I will have covered all of those topics by the time qual comes along.

Monday - Tuesday: 
take a practice test in an exam like environment. Timed. See how I feel and what strategy works. Get a feeling of how I did and what I should work on.

Thrusday - Weekend:
Take two more of those practice tests (have three left). Continue to review and see how I am doing. 

Monday - Friday:
Full on review topic prepping, practice exercises. Take one of the practice tests. At this point, I think that I should be fully prepare for the exam.

Weekend - Monday: 
Light review for the exam and focus on taking full-time exams. Go through the three hours and really practice thinking/figure things out.

Then Tuesday morning take a breather, relax, and start the exam!!!!!!
