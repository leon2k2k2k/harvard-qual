\section{Algebraic Geometry}
There are many different types of Algebraic Geometry problem, roughtly, there is enumerative geometry (incidence, containment, intersections problems), projective geometry (blowups), curves (hyperelliptic, Riemann-Roch), smoothness (show rings not equal by looking at resolutions) . Note that this review is personal and reflect things I am comfortable and uncomfortable with.
